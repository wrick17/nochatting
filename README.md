# nochatting

just a simple chat room app that is built with ReactJS and MaterialUI on top of NodeJS as a POC for learning Redux.

I also learnt how to use gzipping with in ExpressJS :p

The app is hosted at [http://nochatting.herokuapp.com](http://nochatting.herokuapp.com) Give it a shot. It's a public room :D
